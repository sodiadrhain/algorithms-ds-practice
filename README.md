# Algorithms and Data Structures Practice
`We learn`
## Contribution

- Fork current repo

- Make sure your branch is set to default `dev`, 

- Checkout from `dev` to a new branch `dev-{yourName}` for example, `dev-soji`

- Make new changes, pushes, create new files or folders and work with this branch only.

- Push with `git push origin dev-{yourName}`, for example, `git push origin dev-soji`

- Share link to solution using this branch URL/Path when needed

- Best solutions should be put to `dev` branch later on, only when we should do a `git push upstream dev`

- Then you run `git pull upstream dev` for updates when needed

- Finalizing all changes will be put to master, `git push upstream master`
